The campaign setup is `mid magic`. There are people in villages that have never seen magic (or magical beasts) in their entire life, while there are cities who use the magic for different scopes and works in general.

The most common races are humans, dwarves, orcs and halflings.

The adventure take please because (for one reason or another) the characters decide to join a group of workers that need to drain a lake near a isolated tower owned by a noble named Alcide. The caravan will start from a tavern called The Belly Buster placed in Blore the `18th of September`, the group is supposed to meet there the night before.

The lake is around 2 weeks traveling from Blore. So it is necessary that a caravan bring food and materials to the workers, this caravan has to be protected from mercenaries or villains who want to steal the materials, so the group will also be tasked to defend the caravan during the travel.

## Known infos

Blore is a small city known because it's one of the places where The Witchlight Carnival stops for two days every eight years. Villagers are mostly humans and the influence of the carnival is barely visible in terms of magic.

The Witchlight Carnival comes from the Feywild plane and is knows in the material plane to be one of the funniest carnival ever. It is a whimsical fair of dizzying sights and wondrous attractions that visits numerous planets across the material plane once every eight years.
